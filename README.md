## Inspiration
We were inspired by the growing need for effective AI communication skills in a fun, competitive format. Just as typing games have gained popularity, we saw an opportunity to create a game focused on prompt engineering.

## What it does
The Alignment Problem is a competitive game that tests users' abilities to craft effective AI prompts. Players can choose between Rapid Mode for speed or Survival Mode for strategic questioning, all while climbing a leaderboard.

## How we built it
We developed the platform using the MERN stack with Next.js, leveraging Cerebras and Tune to tackle complex problems. The front end features components for user authentication, gameplay, and real-time score tracking, providing a seamless and engaging user experience.

What we used:
- React
- Next.js
- Express
- Node.js
- MongoDB Atlas
- Tailwind CSS
- Tune AI
- Clerk

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully created a fully functional prototype that integrates a leaderboard and competitive elements. The positive feedback from initial testers highlighted the engaging gameplay and the potential for skill improvement.

## What we learned
We learned the importance of user feedback in shaping gameplay dynamics. Additionally, we gained insights into optimizing performance with real-time data processing, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## What's next for The Alignment Problem
We plan to enhance the game with more diverse question categories, expand the user base, and introduce community-driven features like custom challenges. Our goal is to refine the experience and increase engagement!
